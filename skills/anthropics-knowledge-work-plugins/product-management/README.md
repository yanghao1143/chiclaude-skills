# Product Management Plugin

A product management plugin primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application — though it also works in Claude Code. Covers the full PM workflow: writing feature specs, managing roadmaps, communicating with stakeholders, synthesizing user research, analyzing competitors, and tracking product metrics.

## Installation

```
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/product-management
```

## What It Does

This plugin gives you an AI-powered product management partner that can help with:

- **Feature Specs & PRDs** — Generate structured product requirements documents from a problem statement or feature idea. Includes user stories, requirements prioritization, success metrics, and scope management.
- **Roadmap Planning** — Create, update, and reprioritize your product roadmap. Supports Now/Next/Later, quarterly themes, and OKR-aligned formats with dependency mapping.
- **Stakeholder Updates** — Generate status updates tailored to your audience (executives, engineering, customers). Pulls context from connected tools to save you the weekly update grind.
- **User Research Synthesis** — Turn interview notes, survey data, and support tickets into structured insights. Identifies themes, builds personas, and surfaces opportunity areas with supporting evidence.
- **Competitive Analysis** — Research competitors and generate briefs with feature comparisons, positioning analysis, and strategic implications.
- **Metrics Review** — Analyze product metrics, identify trends, compare against targets, and surface actionable insights.
