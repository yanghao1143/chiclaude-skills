# Knowledge Work Plugins

Plugins that turn Claude into a specialist for your role, team, and company. Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Why Plugins

Cowork lets you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose — so your team gets better and more consistent outcomes.

Each plugin bundles the skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents for a specific job function. Out of the box, they give Claude a strong starting point for helping anyone in that role. The real power comes when you customize them for your company — your tools, your terminology, your processes — so Claude works like it was built for your team.

## Getting Started

### Cowork

Install plugins from [claude.com/plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/).

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add the marketplace first
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins

# Then install a specific plugin
claude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins
```

Once installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session (e.g., `/sales:call-prep`, `/data:write-query`).

## How Plugins Work

Every plugin follows the same structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections
├── commands/                    # Slash commands you invoke explicitly
└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically
```

- **Skills** encode the domain expertise, best practices, and step-by-step workflows Claude needs to give you useful help. Claude draws on them automatically when relevant.
- **Commands** are explicit actions you trigger (e.g., `/finance:reconciliation`, `/product-management:write-spec`).
- **Connectors** wire Claude to the external tools your role depends on — CRMs, project trackers, data warehouses, design tools, and more — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Every component is file-based — markdown and JSON, no code, no infrastructure, no build steps.

## Making Them Yours

These plugins are generic starting points. They become much more useful when you customize them for how your company actually works:

- **Swap connectors** — Edit `.mcp.json` to point at your specific tool stack.
- **Add company context** — Drop your terminology, org structure, and processes into skill files so Claude understands your world.
- **Adjust workflows** — Modify skill instructions to match how your team actually does things, not how a textbook says to.
- **Build new plugins** — Use the `cowork-plugin-management` plugin or follow the structure above to create plugins for roles and workflows we haven't covered yet.

As your team builds and shares plugins, Claude becomes a cross-functional expert. The context you define gets baked into every relevant interaction, so leaders and admins can spend less time enforcing processes and more time improving them.

Plugins are just markdown files. Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR.
