## Tagline

60 characters. No period. Must communicate what the product does AND why someone should care.

### Formulas That Work

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Action] for [audience] | "AI writing assistant for developers" |
| [Result] without [pain] | "Beautiful docs without the design skills" |
| [Tool] that [benefit] | "Analytics that explain themselves" |
| [Adjective] [category] | "Instant customer feedback surveys" |
| The [category] for [niche] | "The Figma for data visualization" |

### Examples

```
❌ "The best project management tool ever created" (superlative, 52 chars)
❌ "We help you manage projects better." (vague, has period, 37 chars)
❌ "AI-powered machine learning project management SaaS" (buzzword soup)

✅ "Ship docs in minutes, not days" (31 chars)
✅ "AI turns your data into stories" (32 chars)
✅ "The open-source Calendly alternative" (37 chars)
```

## Timing

### When to Launch

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Day | **Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday** (highest traffic) |
| Time | **12:01 AM PT** (Pacific Time) — start of the PH day |
| Avoid | Weekends, holidays, major Apple/Google events |
| Duration | PH day = midnight PT to midnight PT |

### Why 12:01 AM PT

- Maximum time in the running for daily top spot
- Accumulate upvotes throughout the full day
- Morning email digest (US time) includes your product
- Allows engagement across all US time zones

## Maker Comment

Post within **5 minutes** of going live. This is your pitch.

### Structure

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

[1 sentence: what it is]

[2-3 sentences: why you built it / the problem you noticed]

[1-2 sentences: how it works / key differentiator]

[1 sentence: what's next / what you're looking for]

Would love to hear your thoughts — happy to answer any questions!
```

### Example

```
Hey Product Hunt!

DataFlow turns raw SQL queries into visual dashboards in seconds.

As a data engineer, I was frustrated spending more time formatting
reports than actually analyzing data. Every BI tool I tried required
a PhD in their configuration. So I built DataFlow — paste your SQL,
get a dashboard.

It auto-detects chart types, handles large datasets, and exports
to PDF/PNG with one click.

We're offering 50% off the first year for PH users. Would love
your feedback — what reporting pain points do you have?
```

## Launch Day Playbook

### Before Launch (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Gallery images finalized (5 recommended)
- [ ] Tagline tested with 5+ people (do they understand what it does?)
- [ ] Maker comment drafted and proofread
- [ ] Landing page with PH badge ready
- [ ] Early supporter list ready (people who want to check it out)
- [ ] Social media announcement posts drafted

### Launch Day Timeline

| Time (PT) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 12:01 AM | Product goes live, post maker comment immediately |
| 12:15 AM | Share on personal social media |
| 6:00 AM | First engagement check — reply to all comments |
| 9:00 AM | Share in relevant communities (naturally, not spammy) |
| 12:00 PM | Mid-day check — reply to all new comments |
| 3:00 PM | Share any early traction or interesting feedback |
| 6:00 PM | Evening engagement — reply to remaining comments |
| 11:59 PM | Day ends — results are final |

### Engagement Rules

- **Reply to every comment** — makers who engage get more visibility
- **Ask questions back** — creates conversation threads
- **Be genuine** — don't use canned responses
- **Never ask for upvotes** — against PH terms of service
- **Share the link naturally** — "Check it out at [url]" not "Please upvote"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Launching on Friday/weekend | Low traffic, wasted launch | Tue-Thu only |
| Launching at noon | Half the day already gone | 12:01 AM PT |
| No maker comment | Looks abandoned | Post within 5 minutes |
| Asking for upvotes | Against TOS, can get flagged | Share naturally, let product speak |
| Generic gallery images | Doesn't show the product | Show real UI, real features |
| Not replying to comments | Low engagement signal | Reply to every single comment |
| Too many topics | Dilutes discoverability | Max 3, pick the most specific |
| Tagline with buzzwords | Nobody knows what you do | Clear, specific, benefit-focused |
