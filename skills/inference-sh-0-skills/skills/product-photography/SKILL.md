# Product Photography

Create professional product images with AI via [inference.sh](https://inference.sh) CLI.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.inference.sh | sh && infsh login

# Clean studio packshot
infsh app run bytedance/seedream-4-5 --input '{
  "prompt": "professional product photography, single premium wireless headphone on clean white background, soft studio lighting with subtle shadow, commercial e-commerce style, sharp focus, 4K quality",
  "size": "2K"
}'
```

## Shot Types

### 1. Hero Shot (Primary Image)

The main image customers see first. Clean, focused, aspirational.

```bash
infsh app run bytedance/seedream-4-5 --input '{
  "prompt": "hero product shot, premium smartwatch floating at slight angle, clean gradient background transitioning from white to light grey, dramatic rim lighting, subtle reflection below, commercial photography, magazine quality, sharp details",
  "size": "2K"
}'
```

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Product fills 80% of frame | Maximizes visual impact |
| Slight angle (15-30 degrees) | Adds dimension vs flat front-on |
| One hero light + fill | Creates depth without harsh shadows |
| Neutral or brand-color background | Keeps focus on product |

### 2. Packshot (E-Commerce White Background)

Amazon, Shopify, and most marketplaces require pure white backgrounds.

```bash
# Pure white background packshot
infsh app run bytedance/seedream-4-5 --input '{
  "prompt": "product packshot, leather wallet standing upright at slight angle on pure white background #FFFFFF, soft even studio lighting, no shadows, e-commerce product photography, Amazon listing style, clean sharp focus",
  "size": "2K"
}'
```

**Amazon Requirements:**
- Pure white background (RGB 255, 255, 255)
- Product fills 85%+ of frame
- No props, text, logos, or watermarks
- Minimum 1000px on longest side (1600px+ recommended for zoom)
- JPEG or PNG, sRGB color

### 3. Lifestyle Shot

Product in context — shows how it's used or where it belongs.

```bash
infsh app run bytedance/seedream-4-5 --input '{
  "prompt": "lifestyle product photography, premium coffee mug on rustic wooden table beside an open book and reading glasses, morning sunlight streaming through window, cozy home atmosphere, shallow depth of field, warm tones, editorial style",
  "size": "2K"
}'
```

### 4. Scale Shot

Shows product size relative to familiar objects or human hands.

```bash
infsh app run falai/flux-dev-lora --input '{
  "prompt": "product scale photography, compact portable speaker held in one hand, person showing how small and portable it is, clean blurred background, natural lighting, lifestyle tech photography",
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1024
}'
```

### 5. Detail / Close-Up Shot

Highlights texture, material quality, or specific features.

```bash
infsh app run bytedance/seedream-4-5 --input '{
  "prompt": "extreme close-up product detail, premium leather bag stitching and grain texture, macro photography, shallow depth of field, soft directional lighting highlighting texture, luxury product photography, editorial quality",
  "size": "2K"
}'
```

### 6. Group / Collection Shot

Multiple products or variants together.

```bash
infsh app run bytedance/seedream-4-5 --input '{
  "prompt": "product collection flat lay photography, three skincare bottles arranged in triangular composition on marble surface, minimal props, soft overhead lighting, beauty product photography, editorial style, coordinated brand aesthetic",
  "size": "2K"
}'
```

## Camera Angles

| Angle | Best For | Prompt Keyword |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Eye level** | Most products, relatable | "eye level shot", "straight on" |
| **Slight above (30°)** | Flat lay, food, cosmetics | "overhead angle", "45 degree angle" |
| **Bird's eye (90°)** | Flat lay compositions | "flat lay", "top down", "overhead" |
| **Low angle** | Making products look powerful/premium | "low angle", "looking up at product" |
| **3/4 angle** | Most versatile, shows depth | "three-quarter view", "slight angle" |

## Lighting Setups

| Setup | Look | Prompt Keywords |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Soft box (diffused)** | Even, minimal shadows | "soft studio lighting", "diffused light" |
| **Rim/edge lighting** | Dramatic outline glow | "rim lighting", "edge light", "backlit" |
| **Natural window** | Warm, authentic, lifestyle | "natural window light", "golden hour" |
| **Hard directional** | Strong shadows, editorial | "dramatic directional lighting", "hard shadow" |
| **Flat/even** | E-commerce, no shadows | "even lighting", "no shadows", "flat light" |

## Shadow Types

| Shadow | Effect | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **No shadow** | Clean, floating | Amazon/e-commerce requirements |
| **Contact shadow** | Tiny shadow where product meets surface | Grounded but clean |
| **Drop shadow** | Soft shadow below product | Adds depth, professional |
| **Dramatic shadow** | Long, directional shadow | Editorial, luxury, mood |
| **Reflection** | Mirror-like surface below | Tech, luxury, premium feel |

## Background Guide

| Background | Best For | Prompt Keywords |
|------------|----------|----------------|

## Composition Rules

| Rule | Application |
|------|------------|
| **Rule of thirds** | Place product at intersection points for lifestyle shots |
| **Center dominant** | E-commerce/packshots — product dead center |
| **Negative space** | Leave room for text overlay if marketing use |
| **Leading lines** | Use table edges, shadows to draw eye to product |
| **Odd numbers** | Groups of 3 or 5 products look better than 2 or 4 |
| **Triangle composition** | Arrange 3 items in a triangle for balance |

## E-Commerce Image Set

A complete product listing needs 7-9 images in this order:

| Position | Image Type | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Hero / packshot** | Primary listing image, white background |
| 2 | **Lifestyle** | Product in use/context |
| 3 | **Feature callout** | Key feature highlighted |
| 4 | **Scale reference** | Size in hand or next to known object |
| 5 | **Detail close-up** | Material quality, craftsmanship |
| 6 | **Alternate angle** | Back or side view |
| 7 | **Infographic** | Dimensions, specs, what's included |
| 8 | **Packaging** | Unboxing experience |
| 9 | **Social proof** | Rating overlay or lifestyle with caption |

  "image": "headphones-white.png"

}'
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Busy backgrounds | Product gets lost | Clean, simple backgrounds — product is the star |
| Flat front-on angle | Looks like a mugshot | Slight 15-30° angle adds dimension |
| Wrong lighting for category | Tech on rustic wood, food in cold light | Match lighting to product category conventions |
| Too many props | Distracts from product | Max 2-3 supporting props for lifestyle shots |
| Inconsistent style across set | Looks unprofessional | Same lighting setup, same background family |
| No scale reference | Customers can't judge size | Include at least one shot with hands or known objects |
| Low resolution | Can't zoom, looks amateur | Generate at 2K+ and upscale if needed |
| Perfectly centered everything | Static, boring layout | Use rule of thirds for lifestyle, center only for packshots |
