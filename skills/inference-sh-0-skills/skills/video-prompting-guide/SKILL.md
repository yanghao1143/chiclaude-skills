  "prompt": "Cinematic tracking shot of a red sports car driving through Tokyo at night, neon lights reflecting on wet streets, rain falling, 4K, shallow depth of field"
}'
```

## Prompt Structure Formula

}'
```

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Too vague | "A nice video" | Specify shot, subject, style |
| Too complex | Multiple scenes | One scene per prompt |
| No motion | Static description | Include camera movement or action |
| Conflicting styles | "Minimalist maximalist" | Choose one aesthetic |
| No lighting | Undefined mood | Specify lighting conditions |

## Model-Specific Tips

### Google Veo

- Excels at realistic, cinematic content
- Supports audio generation (Veo 3+)
- Best with detailed, professional prompts
- Frame interpolation available in 3.1

### Seedance

- Strong at dance and human motion
- First-frame control available
- Good for consistent character motion
- Works well with reference images

### Wan 2.5

- Best for image-to-video
- Animates still images naturally
- Good motion prediction
- Works with any image style

### Grok

- Good general-purpose video
- Configurable duration (5-10s)
- Creative interpretations
- Works well with abstract concepts

## Workflow: Iterative Prompting

```bash
# 1. Start with basic prompt
infsh app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "A woman walking through a forest"
}'

# 2. Add specificity
infsh app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "Medium tracking shot of a woman in a red dress walking through an autumn forest"
}'

# 3. Add style and technical details
infsh app run google/veo-3-1-fast --input '{
  "prompt": "Cinematic medium tracking shot of a woman in a flowing red dress walking through an autumn forest, golden hour sunlight filtering through leaves, shallow depth of field, film grain, 4K"
}'
```
