# Product Changelog

Write changelogs and release notes that users read and care about via [inference.sh](https://inference.sh) CLI.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.inference.sh | sh && infsh login

# Generate a feature announcement visual
infsh app run falai/flux-dev-lora --input '{
  "prompt": "clean product UI screenshot mockup, modern dashboard interface showing a new analytics chart feature, light mode, minimal design, professional SaaS product",
  "width": 1248,
  "height": 832
}'
```

## Entry Format

### The Anatomy of a Good Entry

```markdown
### New: Bulk Export for Reports 📊

You can now export up to 10,000 rows at once from any report view.
Select your rows, click Export, and choose CSV or Excel format.

Previously limited to 500 rows per export.

```

**Structure:** Category label -> User-facing title -> What you can do now -> How -> What changed -> Visual

### User-Facing Language

```
❌ Internal language:
"Implemented batch processing queue for the export service"
"Refactored the ReportExporter class to support pagination"
"Fixed bug in CSV serialization (PR #4521)"

✅ User-facing language:
"You can now export up to 10,000 rows at once from any report"
"Reports now load 3x faster when filtering large datasets"
"Fixed an issue where exported CSV files had missing columns"
```

**Rules:**
- Write what the user can DO, not what you BUILT
- Start with "You can now..." / "Reports now..." / "Fixed an issue where..."
- Include the benefit, not just the mechanism
- Use present tense

## Categories

### Standard Categories

| Category | Color | Icon | Use For |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| **New** | Green | ✨ or 🆕 | Entirely new features or capabilities |
| **Improved** | Blue | ⚡ or 🔧 | Enhancements to existing features |
| **Fixed** | Yellow/Orange | 🐛 or 🔨 | Bug fixes |
| **Removed** | Red | 🗑️ or ⚠️ | Deprecated or removed features |
| **Security** | Purple | 🔒 | Security patches |

### Categorization Rules

- **New** = something users couldn't do before at all
- **Improved** = something users could do, now it's better/faster/easier
- **Fixed** = something that was broken, now works correctly
- Don't use "Updated" — it's meaningless. Was it improved or fixed?

## Version Numbering

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  3   .  2  .  1
```

| Component | Increment When | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| MAJOR | Breaking changes, major redesign | 2.0.0 -> 3.0.0 |
| MINOR | New features, backward-compatible | 3.1.0 -> 3.2.0 |
| PATCH | Bug fixes, small improvements | 3.2.0 -> 3.2.1 |

### Date-Based Versioning

```
2026-02-08  or  2026.02.08  or  February 8, 2026
```

Best for SaaS products with continuous deployment.

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes need special treatment:

```markdown
### ⚠️ Breaking: API v2 Endpoints Deprecated

**What changed:** API v1 endpoints will stop working on March 15, 2026.

**What you need to do:**
1. Update your API calls to use v2 endpoints ([migration guide →](link))
2. Update authentication to use Bearer tokens instead of API keys
3. Test your integration before March 15

**Timeline:**
- Now: v2 endpoints available, v1 still works
- March 1: v1 returns deprecation warnings
- March 15: v1 stops working

If you need help migrating, contact support@company.com.

## Writing Tips

### Do

- Group related changes together
- Lead with the biggest/most requested change
- Link to documentation for complex features
- Include who requested it ("By popular request:")
- Show migration paths for breaking changes
- Date every entry

### Don't

- Don't say "various bug fixes" — list specific fixes or skip them
- Don't include internal references (PR numbers, ticket IDs, branch names)
- Don't use "Updated [feature]" without saying how
- Don't list changes nobody cares about (dependency bumps, internal refactors)
- Don't commit-dump — one changelog entry may represent many commits

## Changelog Frequency

| Product Type | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| SaaS (continuous deploy) | Weekly batch | Group a week of changes |
| SaaS (major features) | Per feature launch | With blog post |
| Versioned software | Per version release | Tied to semver |
| API | Per version + deprecation notices | Include migration guides |
| Mobile app | Per app store release | Match store listing "What's New" |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Developer language | Users don't understand | Write what users can do |
| "Bug fixes and improvements" | Zero information | List specific fixes |
| No dates | Can't tell what's new | Date every entry |
| No visuals | Users skip text | Screenshot major features |
| Breaking changes buried | Users discover too late | Prominent warning + timeline |
| Commit log as changelog | Noisy, unhelpful | Curate and rewrite |
