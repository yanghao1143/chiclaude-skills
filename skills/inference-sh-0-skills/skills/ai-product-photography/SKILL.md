}' > upscaled.json

# 3. Remove background if needed

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent style** - Match brand aesthetic across all images
2. **High resolution** - Use quality models, upscale if needed
3. **Multiple angles** - Generate front, side, detail views
4. **Context matters** - Lifestyle images convert better than plain white
5. **Props and staging** - Add relevant props for visual interest
6. **Lighting consistency** - Same lighting style across product line
