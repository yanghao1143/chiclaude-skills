## What are Skills?

Skills are structured knowledge files that give AI coding agents context about a library, framework, or codebase. Unlike MCP servers that provide real-time tool access, skills are loaded directly into the agent's context so it can reference them throughout the conversation.

Nuxt UI provides two skills:

- **Usage skill** — Teaches AI agents how to build UIs with Nuxt UI: installation, theming, components, composables, forms, overlays, and layouts.
- **Contributing skill** — Guides AI agents through Nuxt UI's component structure, theming patterns, testing conventions, and documentation guidelines when contributing to the repository.

## Usage Skill

The usage skill gives AI agents comprehensive knowledge about building with Nuxt UI v4. It covers:

- Installation for Nuxt, Vue, Laravel, and AdonisJS
- Theming and branding with semantic colors and CSS variables
- All 125+ components with props and usage patterns
- Composables (`useToast`, `useOverlay`, `defineShortcuts`)
- Form validation with Standard Schema
- Layout composition (Dashboard, Docs, Chat, Editor)
- Official starter templates

The skill includes additional references that the AI agent loads on demand based on the task, keeping responses focused and context-efficient.

::note
Once installed, you can invoke the skill by typing `/nuxt-ui` in your agent's chat.

### Skills CLI

The [`skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI is the easiest way to install the Nuxt UI skill. It supports 35+ agents including Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Cline, and more.

```bash
npx skills add nuxt/ui
```

You can target specific agents with the `--agent` flag:

```bash
npx skills add nuxt/ui --agent cursor
npx skills add nuxt/ui --agent claude-code
```

Or install globally so the skill is available across all your projects:

```bash
npx skills add nuxt/ui --global
```

```

### Claude Code

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
**Ensure Claude Code is installed.** Visit [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart) for installation instructions.
::

Add the skill using the CLI command:

```bash
claude skill add https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/skills/nuxt-ui
```

### Other AI Tools

The skill files are publicly available on GitHub. You can reference them directly in any AI tool that supports custom context or instructions:

- **Skill entry point**: [`skills/nuxt-ui/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/skills/nuxt-ui/SKILL.md)
- **Full skill directory**: [`skills/nuxt-ui/`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/skills/nuxt-ui)

## Contributing Skill

The contributing skill helps AI agents assist with contributions to the Nuxt UI repository. It automatically guides through:

- Component file structure and naming conventions
- Tailwind Variants theming patterns
- Vitest testing conventions
- MDC documentation guidelines

This skill is located in the repository at [`.claude/skills/contributing/`](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/v4/.claude/skills/contributing) and is automatically picked up when working in the Nuxt UI codebase with Claude Code or Cursor (when using a Claude model). You can also invoke it by typing `/contributing` in your agent's chat.
