:img{src="https://picsum.photos/640/616" width="320" height="308" alt="Illustration" class="w-full rounded-lg"}
::

::

Use it inside a [PageSection](/docs/components/page-section) component or directly in your page:

```vue {4,8-10}
<template>
  <UPageHero />

  <UPageCTA class="rounded-none" />

  <UPageSection />

  <UPageSection :ui="{ container: 'px-0' }">
    <UPageCTA class="rounded-none sm:rounded-xl" />
  </UPageSection>

  <UPageSection />
</template>
```

::tip
Use `px-0` and `rounded-none` classes to make the CTA fill the edge of the page on mobile.
