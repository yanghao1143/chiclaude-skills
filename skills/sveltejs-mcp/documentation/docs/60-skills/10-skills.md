title: Overview

This is the list of available skills provided by the Svelte MCP package. Skills are sets of instructions that AI agents can load on-demand to help with specific tasks.

Skills are available in both the Claude Code plugin (installed via the marketplace) and the OpenCode plugin (`@sveltejs/opencode`). They can also be manually installed in your `.claude/skills/` or `.opencode/skills/` folder.

You can download the latest skills from the [releases page](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp/releases) or find them in the [`plugins/svelte/skills`](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp/tree/main/plugins/svelte/skills) folder.
