# Code Reviewer

AI-powered code review for staged git changes. Catches bugs, security issues, and code smells before you push.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-code-review
```

## What It Does

- Reviews your staged git changes automatically
- Identifies bugs, logic errors, and anti-patterns
- Flags potential security issues
- Suggests concrete improvements with explanations
- Color-coded output (critical/warning/suggestion/good)

## Usage

```bash
# Stage your changes first
git add -A

# Run the review
npx ai-code-review
```

## When to Use

- Right before opening a pull request
- Working solo without a reviewer
- Late night coding when your brain is tired
- Quick sanity check on tricky refactors
