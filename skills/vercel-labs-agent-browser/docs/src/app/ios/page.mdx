# iOS Simulator

Control real Mobile Safari in the iOS Simulator for authentic mobile
web testing. Uses Appium with XCUITest for native automation.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode installed
- iOS Simulator runtimes (download via Xcode)
- Appium with XCUITest driver

## Setup

```bash
# Install Appium globally
npm install -g appium

# Install the XCUITest driver for iOS
appium driver install xcuitest
```

## List available devices

See all iOS simulators available on your system:

```bash
agent-browser device list

# Output:
# Available iOS Simulators:
#
#   ○ iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 18.0)
#     F21EEC0D-7618-419F-811B-33AF27A8B2FD
#   ○ iPhone 16 Pro Max (iOS 18.0)
#     50402807-C9B8-4D37-9F13-2E00E782C744
#   ○ iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) (iOS 18.0)
#     3A6C6436-B909-4593-866D-91D1062BB070
#   ...
```

## Basic usage

Use the `-p ios` flag to enable iOS mode. The workflow is
identical to desktop:

```bash
# Launch Safari on iPhone 16 Pro
agent-browser -p ios --device "iPhone 16 Pro" open https://example.com

# Get snapshot with refs (same as desktop)
agent-browser -p ios snapshot -i

# Interact using refs
agent-browser -p ios tap @e1
agent-browser -p ios fill @e2 "text"

# Take screenshot
agent-browser -p ios screenshot mobile.png

# Close session (shuts down simulator)
agent-browser -p ios close
```

## Mobile-specific commands

```bash
# Swipe gestures
agent-browser -p ios swipe up
agent-browser -p ios swipe down
agent-browser -p ios swipe left
agent-browser -p ios swipe right

# Swipe with distance (pixels)
agent-browser -p ios swipe up 500

# Tap (alias for click, semantically clearer for touch)
agent-browser -p ios tap @e1
```

## Environment variables

Configure iOS mode via environment variables:

```bash
export AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER=ios
export AGENT_BROWSER_IOS_DEVICE="iPhone 16 Pro"

# Now all commands use iOS
agent-browser open https://example.com
agent-browser snapshot -i
agent-browser tap @e1
```

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER` | Set to `ios` to enable iOS mode |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_IOS_DEVICE` | Device name (e.g., "iPhone 16 Pro") |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_IOS_UDID` | Device UDID (alternative to device name) |

## Supported devices

All iOS Simulators available in Xcode are supported, including:

- All iPhone models (iPhone 15, 16, 17, SE, etc.)
- All iPad models (iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, etc.)
- Multiple iOS versions (17.x, 18.x, etc.)

**Real devices** are also supported via USB connection (see below).

## Real device support

Appium can control Safari on real iOS devices connected via USB. This
requires additional one-time setup.

### 1. Get your device UDID

```bash
# List connected devices
xcrun xctrace list devices

# Or via system profiler
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -A 5 "iPhone\|iPad"
```

### 2. Sign WebDriverAgent (one-time)

WebDriverAgent needs to be signed with your Apple Developer
certificate to run on real devices.

```bash
# Open the WebDriverAgent Xcode project
cd ~/.appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent
open WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:

1. Select the `WebDriverAgentRunner` target
2. Go to Signing & Capabilities
3. Select your Team (requires Apple Developer account, free tier works)
4. Let Xcode manage signing automatically

### 3. Use with agent-browser

```bash
# Connect device via USB, then use the UDID
agent-browser -p ios --device "<DEVICE_UDID>" open https://example.com

# Or use the device name if unique
agent-browser -p ios --device "John's iPhone" open https://example.com
```

### Real device notes

- First run installs WebDriverAgent to the device (may require Trust prompt on device)
- Device must be unlocked and connected via USB
- Slightly slower initial connection than simulator
- Tests against real Safari performance and behavior
- On first install, go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management to trust the developer certificate

## Performance notes

- **First launch:** Takes 30-60 seconds to boot the simulator and start Appium
- **Subsequent commands:** Fast (simulator stays running)
- **Close command:** Shuts down simulator and Appium server

## Differences from desktop

| Feature | Desktop | iOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser | Chromium/Firefox/WebKit | Safari only |
| Tabs | Supported | Single tab only |
| PDF export | Supported | Not supported |
| Screencast | Supported | Not supported |
| Swipe gestures | Not native | Native support |

## Troubleshooting

### Appium not found

```bash
# Make sure Appium is installed globally
npm install -g appium
appium driver install xcuitest

# Verify installation
appium --version
```

### No simulators available

Open Xcode and download iOS Simulator runtimes from **Settings → Platforms**.

### Simulator won't boot

Try booting the simulator manually from Xcode or the Simulator app to
ensure it works, then retry with agent-browser.
